  \emph{The Role of Shape in Molecular Crystallisation}
  Organic molecules, despite being comprised from a small subset of the periodic table
  have incredible diversity in their chemical and physical properties.
  While we currently have excellent control and predictability over
  the chemical properties of organic molecules,
  one area which is not properly understood is
  the Crystallisation rates of the molecules.
  This research uses simple molecular systems to
  develop a fundamental understanding of crystallisation
  with a particular emphasis on the role of shape.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implement the calculation of statistical dynamics quantities of translational and rotational motion
      using Python with optimisation of calculations using Cython.
    \item Design simulation strategies to effectively probe the variables of interest.
    \item Create visual representations of data to easily convey complex behaviour using Python.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Achievements}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Winning team of the Inventing the Future Competition
  \end{itemize}

  \emph{The Role of Molecular Shape on the Properties of the Condensed Phase: A Simulation Study}
  Compared to most metals, molecular liquids are phenomenally slow to crystallise,
  with no clear understanding of the six order of magnitude difference.
  A distinguishing characteristic of molecules is their shape.
  In this work molecular dynamics simulations are used to study
  the role of molecular shape on the dynamic and
  structural properties of liquids and crystals.
