{PhD Candidate}
{University of Sydney}{}{}
{%
In my PhD thesis under the supervision of Professor Peter Harrowell,
I am using a combination of
statistical mechanics and data science
study the role of translational and rotational dynamics
of small molecules in the liquid phase.
The understanding of these dynamic quantities is a step
towards understanding the slow crystal growth behaviour of
our molecule of interest.\\
\textbf{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement the calculation of statistical dynamics quantities
  \item Design simulation strategies
  \item Create visual representations of data to easily convert complex behaviour
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Achievements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Winning team, Inventing the Future Competition 2016
  \item Finalist, Merck Innovation Challenge 2018
  \item Journal of Materials Chemistry C Poster Prize
\end{itemize}

{%
In my Honours Thesis titled
``The Role of Molecular Shape on the Properties of the Condensed Phase: A Simulation Study''
I used molecular dynamics simulations of small rigid molecules to investigate how
the shape of the molecule affected the structural and dynamic properties.
I was responsible for the development and implementation of the algorithms to
compute these properties in addition to developing the simulation parameters
to get reliable results. \\
\textbf{Course Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Completed with \nth{1} Class Honours and \nth{1} in my cohort.
  \item Received the Walter J Moore Honours Scholarship for academic merit in Honours.
  \item Received Levy Scholarship for proficiency in \nth{1} year chemistry.
  \item Completed Majors in both Computational Science and Chemistry.
  \item Undertook research with the Harrowell research group as part of the Summer Scholarship Program.
  \item Distinction Average
\end{itemize}
