{%
\textbf{Honours Thesis}\\
  In my Honours Thesis titled 
  ''The Role of Molecular Shape on the Properties of the Condensed Phase: A Simulation Study"
  I used molecular dynamics simulations of small rigid molecules to investigate how
  the shape of the molecule affected the structural and dynamic properties.
  I was responsible for the development and implementation of the algorithms to
  compute these properties in addition to developing the simulation parameters
  to get reliable results. \\
  \textbf{Course Highlights}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Completed with \nth{1} Class Honours and \nth{1} in my cohort.
    \item Received the Walter J Moore Honours Scholarship for academic merit in Honours.
