{PhD Candidate}
{The University of Sydney}{}{}
{%
  I use a combination of statistical mechanics and data science to
  study the translational and rotational dynamics
  of small molecules in the liquid phase.
  Understanding these dynamic quantities is a step
  towards understanding crystal growth.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developing visualisation dashboards for interactive analysis of simulations
    using machine learning.
  \item Orchestrating data generation and analysis pipeline from simulation to
    publication ready figures.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Achievements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Winning team, Inventing the Future Competition 2016
  \item Finalist, Merck Innovation Challenge 2018
  \item Journal of Materials Chemistry C Poster Prize 2018
\end{itemize}
