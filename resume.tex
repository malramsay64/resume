  \emph{The Role of Shape in Molecular Crystallisation}\\
  Organic molecules have incredible diversity in their chemical and physical properties. While we
  have phenomenal control over the chemical properties of organic molecules, we have little
  understanding of their transition from a liquid to a solid. Control over the formation of the
  solid phase, whether a specific crystal polymorph or a disordered glassy phase, opens up a new
  range of possibilities for organic molecules.
  This research uses simple molecular systems to develop a fundamental understanding of
  crystallisation with an emphasis on the role of molecular shape in influencing the formation of
  a glassy solid phase.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop machine learning algorithms for the identification of crystal polymorphs within a
      liquid.
    \item Create new measures of dynamics to capture the complex behaviour of molecular systems.
    \item Create interactive data visualisations to communicate complex behaviour.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Achievements}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Winning team, Inventing the Future Competition 2016

  \emph{The Role of Molecular Shape on the Properties of the Condensed Phase: A Simulation Study}\\
  Compared to metals, molecular liquids are phenomenally slow to crystallise, with no clear
  understanding of six orders of magnitude separating the crystallisation rates of metals and
  molecular liquids.
  In this work molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the role of molecular shape on the
  dynamic and structural properties of liquids and crystals.
  \textbf{Achievements}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Completed with \nth{1} Class Honours and \nth{1} in my cohort.
    \item Received the Walter J. Moore Honours Scholarship for academic merit in Honours.
    \item Received Levy Scholarship for proficiency in \nth{1} year chemistry.
