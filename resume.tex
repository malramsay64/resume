Malcolm is a highly motivated Data Scientist,
experienced in the management, analysis, and communication of data.
Malcolm’s strengths lie in understanding the whole picture of data,
determining an appropriate solution,
and presenting the results in a cohesive and understandable manner.

\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{2021--Present}
{Data Consultant}
{ASG Group}{}{}
{%
  Within ASG, Malcolm is part of the Data Practice, where he is contributes
  through providing mentoring and technical expertise. Additionally, Malcolm is
  part of the ASG Labs project where he works to bring data to life through
  technology demonstrations.
  Malcolm’s initial resposibility at SA Power Networks was to develop a Proof
  of Concept using the Azure Data Engineering stack to cleanup and process
  their network asset data in a robust and automated fashion. This work
  included the development of Databricks Machine Learning workflows to maintain
  the model and data provenance.
  Malcolm took this PoC, developing it into an application for deployment within
  SAPN. As the first application deployed within SAPN using Databricks, Malcolm
  designed the best practices for integrating this platform into the existing
  infrastructure and support model, working with all stakeholders to gain
  approval. Malcolm’s experience with all parts of the Azure Data Dngineering
  stack, including Azure Data Factory, Synapse, Azure Data Lake, Azure SQL, and
  Databricks ensured he was able to make the best use of all the available tools
  to quickly and efficiently deliver the final application.
