I am writing to apply for the position of Science Programmer - Numerical Weather Prediction Upgrade at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

% A solid background in science, mathematics or computing with experience analysing or processing scientific datasets. An understanding of numerical methods used for the analysis and prediction of the atmosphere or ocean would be beneficial.

I have a strong understanding of the computational and mathematical methods required for, the processing of scientific datasets, and the numerical methods used in the solution of partial differential equations used for the prediction of events. During the course of my Honours project I was using molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the dynamics of low temperature molecular liquids. The analysis of the data from these simulations required large amounts of post processing to put the data in a form that is easily to analyse. Over the course of studying my Computational Science Major as part of the coursework I was learning ways to find numerical solutions to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. A significant focus of this study was finding solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation, important for predicting results in Chemistry.

% The ability to contribute to implementing upgrades to operational numerical weather prediction and related software systems, diagnose and prioritise problems and respond to operational incidents. A willingness to participate in an out of hours support roster.



% Well-developed computing skills including code management and testing. Knowledge of scripting in UNIX/Linux environment is essential. Experience in programming languages such as python, C and/or Fortran is also important.

Honours project

% A demonstrated familiarity with software engineering principles



% Personal qualities such as initiative, judgement, perseverance and an ability to work in a team environment and to liaise effectively with research and operations staff.

Army, teamwork, taking orders advice from others to do my job.

% Understanding of the elements of the Bureau's Social Justice Strategy and a commitment to apply them in practice.
