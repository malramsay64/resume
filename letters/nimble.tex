I am writing to apply for the position of Data Scientist at Nimble Australia Pty Ltd as advertised on Seek.

The analysis of data requires both the manipulation of data, and the scientific understanding to extract useful information. As a Computational Chemist my scientific data analysis skills are ideally suited to the role of Data Scientist.

I have enclosed my resume to support my application, showing that I will bring important skills to this position. In my role of Year in Industry Student at the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory I was tasked with developing machine learning tools for the detection of samples containing prohibited substance outside the set of substances tested. Along with this experience my Honours year involved the investigation of 2D molecular crystals, a field with little previous work to draw on. Progress required extensive experimentation and data analysis to test many hypotheses and the use of results from each experiment to influence the direction of the following series of experiments.

I am a good match for your job because of my background in Chemistry and Computer Science, with significant experience in data analysis and visualisation.

Thank you for considering my application and I look forward to hearing from you.
