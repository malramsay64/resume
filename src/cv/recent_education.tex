  Malcolm used a combination of statistical mechanics and data science to
  study the translational and rotational dynamics
  of small molecules in the liquid phase.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Created interactive dashboard in python for analysis of simulations
      combining Bokeh and scikit-learn for real-time machine-learning analysis.
    \item Used infrastructure as code to define reproducible simulation environments
      using Ansible and Docker.
    \item Developed optimised data analysis tools for the analysis of Terabyte sized
      datasets using Python, Cython, C++, and Rust,
      using Git, testing, and CI to ensure high quality code.
    \item Designed effective data visualisations for complex datasets.
  \end{itemize}
